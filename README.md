# Graphs and Graph Algorithms in Java

This repository hosts a Java project focused on exploring graph theory and algorithm design. It contains implementations of several classic graph algorithms, leveraging Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The project is structured around different classes representing various types of graphs.

## Key Implementations

### Undirected Graphs
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**

### Directed Graphs
- **Topological Sorting**
- **Kosaraju-Sharir Algorithm** for Strongly Connected Components

### Weighted Directed Graphs
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm** for Shortest Path
- **Bellman-Ford Algorithm** for Shortest Path
