Graphs and Graph algorithms in Java

This repository hosts a Java project that I, as a student, carried out to delve into the intricacies of graph theory and algorithm design. It contains implementations of several classic graph algorithms and is structured around different classes representing various types of graphs.

KEY IMPLEMENTATIONS
Undirected Graphs
	Depth-First Search (DFS)
	Breadth-First Search (BFS)
Directed Graphs
	Topological Sorting
	Kosaraju-Sharir Algorithm for Strongly Connected Components
Weighted Directed Graphs
	Dijkstra's Algorithm for Shortest Path
	Bellman-Ford Algorithm for Shortest Path
	Johnson's Algorithm for All Pairs Shortest Paths
